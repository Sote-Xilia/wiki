<h2 class="toc-header" id="assistant-quickstart"> Assistant Quickstart</h2><div>
</div><p>The Assistant Quickstart is designed for all Medical Assistants and Nurses to be used as a guide to learn Praxis quickly. There are six key areas covered in this section:</p><div>
</div><p>How to Start</p><div>
</div><p>Praxis Overview (Basic Navigation)</p><div>
</div><p>Checking In a Patient</p><div>
</div><p>Checking Out a Patient</p><div>
</div><p>Activities Outside of a Visit</p><div>

</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="to-log-into-cloud-see-section"> To log into cloud see section =.</h2><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>In order to log in to Praxis, you will need your own log in and password. This typically is provided to you by your office manager or main provider. Please view the video +++Insert video - Basic log in with initial password.</p><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="user-types-assistant-versus-receptionist"> User Types - Assistant versus Receptionist</h2><div>
</div><p>There are three types of staff users in Praxis – Receptionists and Assistants. The other user is the provider/doctor user type. The main difference between Receptions and Assistant is that Receptionist users are necessary for scheduling and marking patients as having arrived in the clinic. Receptionist have restricted access and cannot open up patient charts. This user would be used for arriving patients and documenting messages. Assistant users are the only staff users that can enter information into a patient chart. It is important to note that if an assistant user checks a patient in then Praxis automatically assigns the patient to that assistant. If you need to arrive the patient to a group of assistants then user a receptionist log-in when arriving solves this issue and everyone who is an assistant can see that patient’s name under Patients Here and Waiting in the Home tab. If the assistant arrives the patient for themselves then the clinic will frequently not have a need for a receptionist user.</p><div>
</div><p>In a clinic the staff members frequently perform both check-in and nursing functions. It is possible for a clinic to use a receptionist user to arrive the patient, in can even be a generic user that is open at the front desk area computer. Then the individual user can log in as an assistant to perform check functions such as vital signs, etc and also use this user to access the patient charts. If the receptionist really spends most of her time updating demographics and scheduling – then the ‘generic’ user should be the type of user. However, if the receptionist really needs frequent access to the patient charts and doesn’t do as much scheduling then the ‘generic’ user should be the receptionist user for the occasional scheduling.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>This section of the manual will focus on the functions of the Assistant User.</p><div>
</div><p>If questions regarding what is the best set up option for your particular clinic a Praxis trainer can assist you. To reach assistance log into Praxis chat or email <a href="mailto:app-support@praxisemr.com">app-support@praxisemr.com</a>.</p><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="office-flow-defined"> Office Flow Defined</h2><div>
</div><p>It is key that as an assistant the office flow processes are defined clearly. This will help you understand which aspects of the software you need to learn. Key office flow processes are:</p><div>
</div><h1 class="toc-header" id="praxis-overview-basic-navigation"> Praxis Overview (Basic Navigation)</h1><div>
</div><p>When you initially open up Praxis you will always open to the Home tab. You will also see additional tabs across the top and smaller icons located at the top right. This section of the manual gives an overview of the functions of each section to allow for easy navigation of the software. The following video gives you an overview of the what the main tabs in Praxis do. +++Insert video - Overview of Praxis tabs video.</p><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="home-tab"> Home Tab</h2><div>
</div><p>The Praxis Home tab is the point that Praxis always opens whenever you first log in and informs you of what tasks/activities need attention in the clinic. The Home tab lets you know what patients are in the clinic physically, what messages need to be address and what tasks need to be completed and reviewed.</p><div>
</div><p>Patients Here and Waiting: What patients are here physically and what is their status. +++Insert video – Patients Here and Waiting from the assistant perspective including colors, right click options including changing assistant or provider, setting room numbers, moving patients, ideal to have empty list at the end of the day.</p><div>

</div><p></p><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="medications"> Medications</h2><div>
</div><p>Before you start using Praxis, it is important for each assistant user to address their Medications Settings. Please see the Medication Settings Video to make this important change. As an assistant you will want to mimic the settings of your providers so you may want to consult with them to match their settings. +++Insert Medication Settings video from an assistant perspective.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="vaccines"> Vaccines</h2><div>
</div><p>Praxis has a vaccination module to allow for inventory tracking and ease of documentation. Vaccines work in five different windows:</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>Vaccine List (in Settings-User Application)</p><div>
</div><p>Inventory (in Settings-User Application)</p><div>
</div><p>PreSOAP Note (for the assistant)</p><div>
</div><p>SOAP Generator (in Patient Record)</p><div>
</div><p>Vaccine Application (in Patient Record or in Home - User Application)</p><div>
</div><p>Vaccination Chart (in Patient Record)</p><div>
</div><p>To set up inventory, learn how to administer, print vaccine records for patient, interface with state registries, refer to section XXX.</p><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="selecting-default-provider"> Selecting Default Provider</h2><div>
</div><p>When working in Praxis you will see that a ‘default’ provider’s name will pop up when you select patients, etc. Setting a default provider does not keep the assistant from working with other providers, this just makes the user default to one particular provider. You may change this provider by going to the Settings tab at the top of your User Window. Then click on the More Settings link to the left. Now you may select your default provider from the dropdown list on the right side of the screen. Remember to click Save at the bottom middle.</p><div>

</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="main-tab"> Main Tab</h2><div>
</div><p>On the top left you will see a summary of patient information including name, age and date of birth. Other fields including Assistant, Referring Provider, Adverse Drug Reactions and Insurance.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>On the top right corner shows when the visit was started and the room number. In addition, you can see the timers appearing showing time between appointments under Days, how long the patient has been Waiting Time and Visit Time.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>The “Problem List” Is continually updating as the provider finishes notes. The list sorts into the following categories:</p><div>
</div><p>New</p><div>
</div><p>Active</p><div>
</div><p>Chronic</p><div>
</div><p>Resolved</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>On the left side there are windows for Assistant Note, Vital Signs and Patient Context. The Assistant Note and Vital Signs appear to the provider if the patient has that information documented during a visit. The Patient Context area is for information that the provider wants to follow the patient on every visit.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>On the bottom right you will see categories related to detailed patient information. These buttons will appear only when information has been entered for that patient.</p><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="chart-update-tab"> Chart Update Tab</h2><div>

</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="flow-chart-tab"> Flow Chart Tab</h2><div>
</div><p>In this tab the patients data came be viewed in a flow chart. You can add flow charts for a patient if the flowchart has already been created by the provider. You can view a flowchart in both graphic and textual mode. You can export and print from this tab as well. For more details see section XXX.</p><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="growth-chart-tab"> Growth Chart Tab</h2><div>

</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="patient-data-tab"> Patient Data Tab</h2><div>
</div><p>This is a repeat of patient information that you see in the Database Tab. You see the patients demographics, insurance information, preferred pharmacy, dynamic fields. See section XXX for more details.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><h1 class="toc-header" id="patient-check-in-scheduling"> Patient Check In - Scheduling</h1><div>
</div><p>How to Use the Schedule:</p><div>
</div><p>If you have an appointment on the scheduler for a patient – the person arriving the patient should right-click on the patient’s name and select ‘arrived.’ This will place the patient in the Here and Waiting lists of the provider who is to see the patient and all the assistants (at first) or a specific assistant if assigned. Once an assistant is ready to do their part of the visit all they need to do is to click on the patient’s name in the Here and Waiting list in order to open the visit for them. Once an assistant clicks on a patient’s name in the list, that patient’s name will disappear from all the other assistants’ Here and Waiting lists. (The patient’s name will continue to appear in the receptionist’s list and the provider who is scheduled to see the patient however.)</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>**Important –**If an assistant places a patient appointment in the scheduler – the program will effectively make that Assistant the ‘owner’ of the patient’s visit and none of the other assistants will be able to access that appointment. The Assistant can specific a specific name of an assistant and arrive the patient to them so they can see their name under ‘Patients Here and Waiting’. Patient appointments placed in the scheduler placed by a receptionist or provider user will arrive the patient to the assistant group.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>How to Navigate (if not using Praxis to schedule):</p><div>
</div><p>If you are scheduling out of a different software then you can use the scheduler as a reference as you can see the patients that the provider has seen on any given day. The names appear on the Praxis scheduler as soon as the patient is arrived whether you use the Praxis scheduler or not. If you are not using the Praxis Scheduler - the receptionist user (or the Assistant user who will be charting the visit) may simply click on the Here and Waiting link on their Main Page in order to pop up the patient list. Be sure that the correct provider name at the top, if not you may click the Change button to select the correct provider. Selecting the patient name will begin the visit.</p><div>
</div><h1 class="toc-header" id="triage-a-patient"> Triage a Patient</h1><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="arriving-patients"> Arriving Patients</h2><div>
</div><p>Receptionist Users:</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>If your clinic <strong>does use</strong> the Praxis Scheduler – the Receptionist user(s) should right-click on the patient’s name in the schedule and choose “Arrived.”&nbsp;<br>
If your clinic <strong>does NOT</strong> use the Praxis Scheduler – The Receptionist user(s) should click on the Patients Here and Waiting link on their home page and select the patient to be seen, and select the correct provider in order to place the patient in the Here and Waiting list. (You can check the name of the provider on the left and change it on the right – see screen shot below). At this point the patient’s name will be in <strong>black</strong> for the assistants (ready to be seen by them) and receptionists and in <strong>blue</strong> for the provider (not yet ready to be seen by them).</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><img alt="" src="/assistant_quickstart/5d6f2f14d47320ecb4915a6239c66ab0_html_36135a82.png"></p><div>
</div><p><em>Patient is seeing the provider listed at the top, if incorrect click ‘Change’ to switch providers</em></p><div>
</div><p>The patient’s name will appear in all Assistant’s Here and Waiting lists at first and the assistant who will be recording the visit information needs to simply click on their name in the list in order to begin the visit. (<em>Note: at this point the only assistant who sees the patient’s name in the list is that assistant who picked up the visit. The patient will still be seen in the list by the Receptionist and the Provider who will be seeing the patient however. Their name will be in <strong>red</strong> while their chart is being accessed by a user also.)</em></p><div>
</div><p>When the assistant is finished with their portion of the visit, they can then transfer the patient to the provider. At that point the patient’s name will be in <strong>blue</strong> for the assistant (signifying they’ve sent the patient to the provider) and turn <strong>black</strong> for the provider (letting them know the patient is ready to be seen by them). To learn how to chart on the patient see ‘Charting a patients’ preSOAP note below.</p><div>
</div><p>When the provider exits the patient’s visit (whether by finishing or marking the visit unfinished) the patient’s name should disappear from the list.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><h1 class="toc-header" id="patients-here-and-waiting"> Patients Here and Waiting</h1><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="home-screen"> Home screen</h2><div>
</div><p>The Patients Here and Waiting list you see on your Home Screen should show the patients that have actually entered the clinic to be seen throughout the day. At the end of the day, if the visits have been addressed, the Here and Waiting list should be empty.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><img alt="" src="/assistant_quickstart/5d6f2f14d47320ecb4915a6239c66ab0_html_162d2003.png"></p><div>
</div><p><em>Patients Here and Waiting List</em></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>The patient enters the clinic and is entered by the front office staff by either clicking on the link directly and choosing the patient’s name from the list or right-clicking on their name in the Scheduler. <em>(Note: this is depending on if you are using the Praxis scheduler or a different scheduler).</em></p><div>
</div><p>Once the patients name is selected as “Patient Arrived” – at this point the patient’s name should appear in all the assistants’ lists in <strong>BLACK</strong> (waiting to be seen by the assistant), and in the Provider’s list who will be seeing the patient name in BLUE (denoting that they still need to be seen by the assistant and are not ready for the provider just yet).</p><div>
</div><p>An Assistant clicks on the patient name in order to begin the visit – at this point their name turns RED in the list letting the users know that the patient’s chart is open by a user at that point.</p><div>
</div><p>At the end of the Assistant’s charting they choose to ‘Send Patient to Provider’. At this point the patient’s name turns BLUE in the Assistant’s list (letting them know the patient’s visit has been sent to the Provider), and the patient’s name turns <strong>BLACK</strong> in the Provider’s list (letting them know the patient is ready to be seen by the provider).</p><div>
</div><p><img alt="" src="/assistant_quickstart/5d6f2f14d47320ecb4915a6239c66ab0_html_afcaba73.png"></p><div>
</div><p><em>Summary of Patients Here and Waiting Colors</em></p><div>
</div><p>The Patients Here and Waiting list you see on your Home Screen should show the patients that have actually entered the clinic to be seen throughout the day. At the end of the day, if the visits have been addressed, the Here and Waiting list should be empty.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>It is important that the list not be allowed to exceed too many patient names as this will cause many problems over time (Praxis speed issues, inability to create additional appointments for patients still showing in the list, etc.).</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><em><em>TIP 1</em>:</em> How to remove names from the ‘Patients Here and Waiting’ list – if there are names in the list that have been there for quite some time and they do not have a visit attached that needs to be saved you can right-click on the name and choose to “Close Appointment.” If there is a visit that needs to be saved to the chart - then you will not want to close the appointment as this will cause you to lose any information that was charted for that visit. In this case, you will need to have the provider open the visit and then mark it as finished or unfinished in order to save the information to the patient chart.</p><div>
</div><p><em><em>TIP 2</em></em><em>:</em> At the end of the day, the goal is to have the Here and Waiting list empty of patients. As the patients progress through the clinic, the colors will change for each involved Praxis user, and the patient will disappear from the list when the Provider either marks the visit as finished or unfinished.</p><div>
</div><h5 class="toc-header" id="patient-here-and-waiting-list-options"> Patient Here and Waiting List Options</h5><div>
</div><p><strong>Appointments</strong>: A right click over the patient name appearing under Patients Here and Waiting allows for the assistant to modify the appointment. ‘New Appointment’ allows for a new appointment to be added to the scheduler and it can be for any patient, ‘Edit Appointment’ allows you to modify the existing appointment. Close Appointment allows for the appointment to be removed for the Patients Here and Waiting list as well as removed from the Scheduler.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><strong>Room Number:</strong> A user can specify the location of the patient by right clicking over the patient name and select ‘Place Room Number’. If the room number is not listed, type the name of the room in the small window and click Enter on the keyboard to add for that patient. These room number will appear in the list in the future.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><strong>Transfer Patient to Provider:</strong> At any point an assistant can right click and select ‘Transfer Patient to Provider’.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><strong>Refresh:</strong> In order to refresh the patient list, a user can right click directly over ‘Patients Here and Waiting’ or you can right click on a patients name and select ‘Refresh’.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><strong>Change Provider:</strong> An assistant can right click over the patient name to change which provider a patient will be seeing for their visit. Note: An assistant will see the ‘Change Assistant’ greyed out. If the Assistant need to be changed choose the right click option of ‘Edit Appointment’ and change the Assistant name.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><strong>Edit Private:</strong> This is a section that a user can document private patient specific information.</p><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="entering-allergies"> Entering Allergies</h2><div>
</div><p>Charting a patient’s preSOAP note</p><div>
</div><p>Single left click on the patient’s name in the Here and Waiting list to open the visit as described above (names in black are ready to be seen by the Assistants)</p><div>
</div><p>From the provider’s preSOAP profile list that pops up, select either the closest to the visit you are entering or click cancel in order to start with a blank note. (<em>these are provider-specific and you will see a different list of profiles for each provider</em>).</p><div>
</div><p>Starting top down, enter the patient’s Adverse Drug Reactions by left clicking on the Adverse Drug Reactions link at the top left. A window will pop up so you can enter the allergy by either selecting the allergy listed or if you do not find the allergy then click on the Import button on the top right of the screen. You can start to find the allergies by typing a few letters of what you are looking for into the search bar. Once you find the Allergy double click on the name and you will see that allergy pop into the note. You may enter more additional allergies by repeating this process.</p><div>

</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="entering-medications"> Entering Medications</h2><div>
</div><p>To enter medications for the first time in Praxis for a patient:</p><div>
</div><p>Click on Current Medications to add the medications that the patient walked in the door taking. You will see a window pop up like the example below.</p><div>
</div><p>Type a few letters of the medication in the search/insert bar at the top of the editor. If the medication you are looking for appears in the list, double click on it.</p><div>
</div><p>If the medication you are looking for does not appear in the list when search for – click on the Import button in the far right of the window. This will open the DIT coder. The coder has two columns – the left column is the brand name and the right column is the generic name.</p><div>
</div><p>If the medication does not show, try putting the cursor at the end of the medication name you entered and slowly begin hitting the backspace key in order to search for more medications. Frequently, the problem is the misspelling of the medication.</p><div>
</div><p><img alt="" src="/assistant_quickstart/5d6f2f14d47320ecb4915a6239c66ab0_html_6edd272e.png"></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>Note: You will want to choose medications in black text over the medications in red text. Red text indicates the medication is not linked so Praxis cannot alert to any drug interactions.</p><div>

</div><p>The Dose Form Bracket</p><div>
</div><p>Directions – this bracket holds the free text for the medication and you may select from the list that appears or add to the list by typing into the bar at the top and then hitting Enter on your keyboard.</p><div>
</div><p>Amount Bracket and Refill X Bracket– these brackets are listed in a light red color. For new patients you will leave these untouched as the documentation is for the returning patient and you will see the previous prescription carry forward. It is always best to check with the provider to determine what information they want filled in before transferring the chart to them.</p><div>
</div><p>You may continue to click on the Current Medications link on the note in order to open the editor and continue to enter the medications until they all appear on the note.</p><div>
</div><p>For new patients you will see no medications listed (exception will be if you have patient information transferred from another source then you will instead reconcile the medications). Enter the new medications by clicking the Import button to the right.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><strong>To Update a Patient’s Current Medications (patient is returning) –</strong> If your patient has had medications entered for them in the past they will be a part of the patient’s medical record. They may or may not appear in dehighlighted text on the Current Medications depending on whether or not they were activated on the prior visit. If they were activated on a prior visit and you see them on the note in ~light gray text with a strikeout line~, you may re-activate them by merely left clicking on them. This is a toggle – if you left click on them again, they will deactivate again. <em>(Note: if a medication <strong>was not</strong> activated on a past visit then it will not appear on the note but <strong>will</strong> still appear in the patient’s medications history.)</em></p><div>

These profiles can be created/edited by either the assistant or the provider. To set up a profile, click on your Settings Tab at the top of your user window and click on More Settings in the left column (see picture below). The profiles are specific to each provider, so select your provider to the right and click Save at the bottom. The list of profiles that you create will be provider-specific. So, depending on who the patient is going to see, you will see that provider’s list of profiles at the beginning of the visit. If you work with multiple providers, you may want to create different (or identical) profiles for each of them.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>

</div><p><em>How to access the Pres-SOAP profile</em></p><div>
</div><p>Click on Vital Signs under Objective on the left side of the screen. In the editor window that pops up, double click on all vital signs you would usually record. If you may use the vital sign make sure the line disappears by double left clicking. If you make a mistake just double click and you will see the vital sign deactivated. Don’t worry if you activate some that you don’t <em>always</em> use, as if you leave the value blank it will not print but it will be there on the SOAP note for you to enter if you do need it for a patient. It is better to have the option activated even if you don’t always document all vital signs activated. When you are finished click OK at the bottom of the note. You will then see those Vital Signs on the Pre-SOAP. Note: If you are missing a vital sign from the list ask the provider to activate it for you from the users.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>

</div><p><em>Activating vital signs</em></p><div>
</div><p>To add Clinical Parameters you will do the same process. Double left click on ‘Clinic Parameters’ then double click on those that need. Then click ‘OK’ at the bottom and you will see those appear. If your provider would like you to do Labs before you transfer the patient to the provider then you can add those to the Pres-SOAP profile. Examples of Labs that some clinics have the assistant do before seeing the doctor include urinalysis, pregnancy test, glucose test.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>Assistants have access to documenting Patient Specific Information. If the provider would like to have this type of information documented for them the categories can be activated in order to remind the assistant to add or edit the information. This is done by double left clicking on ‘Patient Specific Information’ then double click on the categories such as ‘Social History’, ‘Family History’, ‘Past Surgical History’, etc. Then click ‘Save’ at the top. You will then see the categories appear on the Pre-Soap.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>It is key to make sure that the profiles are saved. To do this click on the Save Knowledge button at the bottom of the screen. When the box pops up, label it something that makes sense to you (i.e. ‘Vital Signs’, ‘New Visit’, ‘Diabetic’, ‘Well Child’, ‘Routine Visit’ etc.) and click OK.</p><div>

</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="chart-update"> Chart Update</h2><div>
</div><p>It is possible in Praxis to update the patient’s chart without having to generate a visit. In this manner you can update a patient’s medication reactions, current medications, and even the Patient Specific Information protocols as discussed above. To start a Chart Update for a patient, please follow these steps.</p><div>
</div><p>From the Database tab, find the patient name in the list and right click on their name and choose Chart Review or you can just left click on Chart Review on the bottom left.</p><div>
</div><p>When the patient’s chart opens for you – click on the Chart Update tab at the top of the screen.</p><div>
</div><p>Enter any of the Allergies, Medications or Patient Specific information.</p><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="entering-patient-specific-information-outside-a-visit"> Entering Patient Specific Information Outside a Visit</h2><div>
</div><p>Updating the Patient Specific Information (PSI) can easily be done by clicking on the Patient Specific Information label on the SOAP note and then double clicking on the name of the form that you would like to add to the patient’s chart in the list on the left (if the category is not already showing). This will add that form to the patient’s chart (on the right side of the screen). There you will be able to double click on text in order to activate it, fill in the brackets, and also add any information that is needed by merely placing the cursor and then typing the necessary information directly in. Once you are finished, just click on the Save button at the top of the editor to be taken back to the SOAP note.</p><div>
</div><p>Note - anything that you do on the right side of the screen within the Patient Specific Information editor will not affect anyone else’s chart – just that particular patient’s.</p><div>
</div><p>When you are finished updating the Patient’s Chart – just click on the Close button in the top right corner of the chart. This will open a small editor prompting you for a title (leave it set as Chart Update usually) and contain two small boxes for you to check – one top print and one to SAVE. Be sure to check the SAVE box in order for your changes to be made a part of the patient’s record. The information will now be updated and will carry forward to the next time the chart is opened.</p><div>
</div><h1 class="toc-header" id="agents-1"> Agents</h1><div>
</div><p>What is an agent? Agents is the term used by Praxis that work a lot like email. Agents have the function of essentially an interoffice messaging system and a way to communicate with the patient via the portal. The purpose to warn, advise and remind as well as ensure what you want done. Agents can document automatically into the patient’s chart. There are two types of agents in Praxis, free agent and soap agents. The agents work the same but originate differently. The free agent is generated from outside the visit note while the SOAP agent is created from the providers note.</p><div>

Praxis allows each provider to control their own inbox by using filtering rules which allows the provider to decide by Label what messages they see in their in box and what messages go directly to the chart. From an assist perspective if the message needs to be saved in the chart then the message ultimately needs to be sent to the provider. Office protocols between the Provider and the Assistant will need to be established to allow the assistant to know which Label to use for which type of messages.</p><div>

</div><p>Agent forms will speed the process of sending repetitive types of documents to a patient chart. A great example of an agent form is documenting phone calls that come in with questions for doctors or nurses. This is created using NEW FORM button at the top of the Agents window.</p><div>
</div><p><img alt="" src="/assistant_quickstart/5d6f2f14d47320ecb4915a6239c66ab0_html_615a83a3.gif"></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><em>Enter new form name click Enter to add a new form</em></p><div>
</div><p>You can create a new form by enter the name as shown above or clicking on the ‘New Form’ button on the top right either option will bring up the editor where you can set up pre-selected options.</p><div>
</div><p><img alt="" src="/assistant_quickstart/5d6f2f14d47320ecb4915a6239c66ab0_html_f4a2a989.gif"></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><em>Agent Form Editor Window</em></p><div>
</div><p>In this example above (the phone calls that come in from patients for the doctor) you will want to set:</p><div>
</div><p>The label for ‘_phone calls’ for the default phone call form</p><div>
</div><p>Select “Patient Related” to identify the correct patient</p><div>
</div><p>Select “Save in Chart” if you want the information to be saved in the patient’s record</p><div>
</div><p>Select “First Reader” to the far right - so that the Agent will not stay in all providers’ inboxes, but will disappear from additional providers’ inboxes as soon as the first provider to pick it up marks it as saved. You can also leave this field blank if you wish to choose the provider at the time you are sending the message.</p><div>
</div><p>Enter any repetitive information in the text field below. This will prevent the information from having to be entered for all agents of this type. If you are repeating a message over and over again you will want to create agent forms to speed up the process.</p><div>
</div><p>When you are finished click ‘Save’ to name the form. The name will show up in the agent form options as well as the name of the form will automatically show up as the Subject line of the agent.</p><div>
</div><p>When you select this form from the list on the left in the future it will immediately prompt the user for a patient’s name, and then will automatically populate the label, be marked to save in the patient chart, and will contain the text you have entered with the form. The Subject line can be filled out on a case-by-case basis it will automatically populate with the label of the form, but can be edited.</p><div>
</div><p>Another example of an Agent Form - inserted images in a patient chart</p><div>
</div><p>From your Agents tab - click on the empty bar at the top of the list of Agent Forms at the left and type in the new label of the form you’d like to create and hit Enter. Fill out the above fields somewhat the same as above. Select a label (i.e. “Graphic Images” etc.), set the Providers as the recipients (as should be in all agents to go to the patient’s charts), select Patient-Related, Save In Chart. At the bottom left of the editor you will also want to select the “Has Attachments” box which will open some additional icons to the right.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><img alt="" src="/assistant_quickstart/5d6f2f14d47320ecb4915a6239c66ab0_html_d27f64a3.gif"></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><em>Agent forms: setting up ‘Attachments’</em></p><div>
</div><p>If you are sending a graphic image to the patient’s chart that you would like to draw on in the editor (i.e. a body diagram) you could select an individual file to open for agents of this type. If you are sending an individual document (i.e. a photo of the patient’s wound) you could select the default folders where you save this type of document. Selecting a file or folder path is optional.</p><div>
</div><p>When you open a form of this type the program will first ask you to select the patient from the list, and then will take you directly into the Media Editor. If you set a file or folder path with the form it will take you directly to the file or folder. If you didn’t set a path, it will just take you into the Media Editor where you can select from the buttons on the right the individual file or even open your scanning software if this option has been configured.</p><div>
</div><p>As in the first example, it will also populate the patient’s information that you have saved with the form.</p><div>

</div><p>The request will then be sent to the selected provider. From your Home tab you will see a folder on the left under your “COMPLETED BY ME” folder labeled “Prescriptions Sent”. Your sent prescriptions will be accessible here until the provider has picked them up. When the provider has picked up the prescription and approved or denied it, you will then see the patient’s name move to your “TASKS TO DO AND REVIEW” section in the “Prescriptions Received” folder. Even if the medications were ePrescribed you will still receive them back in this folder. Click on the patients’ names in the list in order to open them individually and see if there is anything that needs to be done by you (phoning them or faxing them in, Provider comments, etc.).

</div><p>About Flowcharts - Praxis flowcharts can utilize data from laboratory results, vital signs recorded, clinical parameters recorded and medications. The information in the patient’s chart will be continually updated as this information is recorded for them. The source of the flow chart information can be entered in one or more of the following areas: vital signs, clinical parameters, clinical laboratories (those results that are received in an ‘electronic format’ via an interface with your laboratory) and medications.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>Location of Flowcharts – Each patient’s chart has a Flowcharts tab. Go to the Database tab, select the patient, click on ‘Chart Review’ and the Flowchart tab is the one of the tabs you see to the right of the ‘Studies’ tab. You will see the list of flowcharts that your clinic has set up listed on the left side column.

</div><p>BMI is a calculated formula and as an assistant you should never click inside the bracket and manually enter as it will calculate automatically as soon as you enter in the Height and Weight. If the BMI formula does get over written then an assistant or a provider can fix this. The calculated formula for the BMI that you would need to enter once it has been created is “(VS.Weight.Value)*703/(VS.Height.Value)^2” if you use “Weight” and “Height” as your labels. If you use a different label for these elements you would replace the wording with your labels being sure to enter the period in the label also. If your label for height is “Ht.” you would then need to be enter two periods in the calculation - “<a class="is-external-link" href="http://VS.Ht">VS.Ht</a>..Value” etc. You can also get the vital sign by right clicking selecting Datum, then Vital Signs, then the vital sign Value.</p><div>

</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>Using the free agents function in Praxis you can attach a document directly instead of using Scanaway. Agents themselves as well as attaching documents work in a similar way as e-mail.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>Attaching images using an Agent from the Agent tab</p><div>
</div><p>Click on the Agents tab at the top of your user’s window</p><div>
</div><p>Click on the Create button at the top left (please see the instructions below for creating “forms” to</p><div>
</div><p>make this process easier)</p><div>
</div><p>Select the label for this type of document (i.e. lab result, patient correspondence, referral letter, image of wound, etc.)</p><div>
</div><p>Select the patient by clicking on the button at the top with the card file icon and select the patient from the list</p><div>
</div><p>Select the recipient (remember that if an agent is generated by a user other than a provider, a provider MUST be selected as the recipient in order for the document/agent to make its way to the patient’s chart). <em>Note: if the agent is generated by an assistant or a receptionist, the program will automatically fill in the patient’s primary care provider of record in the recipients’ field.</em></p><div>
</div><p>Choose “now” as the delivery date</p><div>
</div><p>You may enter additional information in the Subject field that further describes the document you are sending to the chart (i.e. ‘referral letter from Dr. Jones,’ ‘arm laceration’, etc.)</p><div>
</div><p>Click on the paperclip button at the top of the agent in order to open the Media Editor.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>On the right side of the media editor, you will see a row of buttons that will allow you to either navigate to the document you would like to attach.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><img alt="" src="/assistant_quickstart/5d6f2f14d47320ecb4915a6239c66ab0_html_98e1bc0d.gif"></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>General Tips:</p><div>
</div><p>- If a Provider generates the agent, it will be automatically filed in the patient’s chart. If the agent is generated by an Assistant or Receptionist, it will need to either be reviewed by the Provider and saved to the chart, or sent with a “Filtered Label” in order for it to have gone directly to the chart.</p><div>
</div><p>-You may attach more than one document to an agent, or more than one scanned page - just click on the paperclip button to open or scan again before sending the agent.</p><div>
</div><p>-Once you have attached an image file to the agent you may right click on the image in the Media Editor window in order to rotate, flip, resize the image etc.</p><div>
</div><p>-The best formats to use when attaching a document are JPEG and pdf. When you are sending documents that are not in a purely ‘graphic’ format (purely graphic format files will have the extensions: .jpg, .bmp, .tiff, etc.) you will need whatever application that handles that type of document loaded on all your workstations in order to view that document everywhere Praxis is installed. Again, for graphics it is best to use JPEG format. If you use Adobe (.pdf) files make sure that you have Adobe installed so that you are able to open the images.</p><div>
</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="how-do-i-make-a-patient-deceased-deactivated-or-reactivated"> How do I make a patient deceased, deactivated or reactivated?</h2><div>
</div><p>You may mark patients as deactivated or deceased from the Database tab. The list has options to fill in the ‘dot’ at the bottom that show which patients you are viewing in the list. You may not ‘delete’ patients, but you can deactivate them.</p><div>
</div><p>Find the patient that you would like to deactivate and right-click on their name in the list.</p><div>
</div><p>From the drop-down list select either ‘deactivate patient’ or ‘patient deceased’. If you select ‘deactivate’ the patient name will immediately disappear from the list. If you select ‘patient deceased’ you will be prompted to enter a date if you like, this is not required.</p><div>
</div><p>In order to see those patients who have been removed from the list of Active patients you can change the option below to:</p><div>
</div><p><em>Inactive patients</em> - this will show a list of all patients deactivated in the database</p><div>
</div><p><em>Patients deceased</em> - this will show all of the patients who have been marked as deceased</p><div>
</div><p><em>All Patients</em> - this will show all the patients, no matter their status. The active patients will be in black text, the deactivated patients in gray text, and the deceased patients in red text.</p><div>
</div><p><em>Active patients</em> - this will show just those patients who are active in the database</p><div>
</div><p>Note: you can always reactivate patients by finding their name and right-clicking on their name in order to mark them as active again. You can even ‘resurrect’ those patients you marked as deceased by choosing that option from the drop down list using the right-click option.</p><div>
